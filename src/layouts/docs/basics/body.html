  <h2 id="basics-api-flow">API Flow</h2>
  
  <p>At the highest level you can imagine that the core flow through the API is this:
    <img src="img/flow.png" alt="Image showing the high level flow through the API." />
  </p>

  <p>Sites have Microcosms. Microcosms have types of content that include Conversations, Events and Polls. Those types of content can additionally have Comments. Sites also have Profiles, and as a convenience method we provide WhoAmI to redirect you to the profile of the authenticated user.</p>

  <p>That is overly simplistic, of course; Comments are made by Profiles, and an Event describes which Microco.sm it is in, etc. but as a high-level view it suffices.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-terminology">Terminology</h2>

  <p>If you're coming from other forum/community software then you can translate things in this way:</p>

  <h2 id="basics-boiler">Boiler Plate</h2>

  <p>Our responses are wrapped in boiler plate JSON that helps to describe what has happened. The purpose of this is to support callbacks, provide a really simple way of getting error/success information, and to additionally support the use of JSONP to those who need it.</p>

  <p>All responses are wrapped in this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "context": "",
  "status": 200,
  "data": null
  "error": null
}</code></pre>

  <ul>
    <li><code>context</code> = A string value given to the API via the querystring <code>?context=foo</code> would be returned to you here. This enables you to make asynchronous callbacks and to include a token that can identify which request this response relates to.</li>
    <li><code>status</code> = The integer HTTP status of the response. You should use the HTTP header status, this is provided to help JSONP requests.</li>
    <li><code>data</code> = The actual JSON representation of the resource requested.</li>
    <li><code>error</code> = An array of strings that contain any error messages. If error is null, then no error has occurred.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All of the above will be returned on every call, null and "" are used to represent an absense of data (no context supplied, no data retrieved, and no error).</p>

  <p>The boiler plate can be disabled by ensuring <code>disableBoiler</code> is set in the querystring like this: <code>/api/version/resource?disableBoiler</code> or within a HTTP header like this: <code>X-Disable-Boiler: true</code>. With either of those set only the data object would be returned in the body of the response.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-statuscodes">HTTP Status Codes</h2>

  <p>We only return a few <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt" title="RFC 2616">HTTP status codes</a> that generally describe the state of a request, your application need only handle these status codes:</p>

        <td>501</td>
        <td>Not Implemented</td>
        <td>The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.

      </tr>

  <h2 id="basics-callbacks">Callbacks</h2>

  <p>We support callbacks using JSONP. To achieve that 3 things are needed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The ability to wrap the returned JSON in a callback function.</li>
    <li>The ability to override the HTTP method so that you can perform the action of HTTP PUT and HTTP DELETE via HTTP POST.</li>
    <li>The ability to only ever return a HTTP 200 OK status.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To fulfil the first requirement you can wrap the response in a callback function name you provide by adding <code>callback=funcName</code> to the querystring of your request.</p>

  <p>To fulfil the second requirement you can overload the HTTP method by making a HTTP POST request and adding <code>method=PUT</code> or <code>method=DELETE</code> as necessary to the querystring. You also have the option to use the standard <code>X-HTTP-Method-Override</code> HTTP header.</p>

  <p class="well well-small">Note: If you are not using JSONP or have not proven that you require HTTP method overriding, then please do not do this. Instead just use the correct HTTP verb when you make your request. HTTP PUT and DELETE are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Idempotent_methods_and_web_applications">idempotent</a> whereas HTTP POST is not, and this can create issues.</p>

  <p>To fulfil the third requirement you may add <code>always200</code> to the querystring or <code>X-Always-200: true</code> to the HTTP headers and this will force the API to only ever return a HTTP 200 OK header regardless of what happened. The <code>status</code> property in the boiler plate JSON will still give the underlying HTTP status code so that you can handle the response appropriately.</p>

  <p>This means that to make a JSONP request for GET and POST, you merely have made a request similar to <code>/api/version/resource?always200&amp;callback=funcName</code> and for PUT and DELETE you have additionally added <code>&amp;method=PUT</code> or <code>&amp;method=DELETE</code> as necessary to the querystring.</p>

  <p class="well well-small">Note: You should not combine <code>disableBoiler</code> with the JSONP features, as the API will only ever be returning HTTP 200 OK, and you will need to check the <code>status</code> property of the boiler plate.</p>

  <p>You are also able to provide <code>context</code> via the querystring and whatever the value of that parameter is will be provided back to you in the <code>context</code> property of the boiler plate.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-urls">URL Patterns</h2>

  <p>The base path of the API is <code>https://{subdomain}.microco.sm/api/v1</code>. Even if a site has a CNAMEd domain such as http://example.com , the API will always be served over SSL on a {subdomain}.microco.sm URL. All resources are children of that base path. Throughout this documentation you will see that base path written in shorthand as <code>/api/v1</code>.</p>

  <p>There are two patterns of URLs, and which is used is determined by whether the resource name in the URL is pluralised or not. Resources that are pluralised represent collections <code>/api/v1/things</code>, and resources that are not pluralised represent a single resource <code>/api/v1/thing</code>.</p>

  <p>Single resources tend to be descriptive meta-data only and will usually only respond successfully to a GET request.</p>

  <p>Resource URLs never end in a trailing slash, as resources are themselves the entity you operate on, and a trailing slash would indicate a directory on the web server.</p>

  <p class="well well-small">Note: If you add trailing slashes then the API returns a 404 Not Found response. Resources are not directories.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-pagination">Pagination</h2>

  <p>Pagination of collections is supported using the offset approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>limit</code> = <code>/api/v1/things?limit=10</code> would return up to 10 'things'.</li>
    <li><code>offset</code> = <code>/api/v1/things?offset=50</code> would return up to the default number of 'things' starting at the 50th record.</li>
    <li><code>limit</code> with <code>offset</code> = <code>/api/v1/things?limit=10&amp;offset=30</code> would return up to 10 'things' starting at the 30th record.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The default value for <code>limit</code> is 25, and the default value for <code>offset</code> is 0. Meaning that if you do nothing, then you will get up to 25 records at the beginning of the collection.</p>

  <p>The format of our collections is consistent, all resources that return a collection of resources will do so using this structure:</p>

<pre><code>"collectionName": {
  "total": 861,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 100,
  "maxOffset" 860,
  "totalPages": 87,
  "page": 11,
  "links": [
    {"rel": "first", "href": "/api/v1/things?limit=10"},
    {"rel": "prev", "href": "/api/v1/things?limit=10&offset=90"},
    {"rel": "self", "href": "/api/v1/things?limit=10&offset=100"},
    {"rel": "next", "href": "/api/v1/things?limit=10&offset=110"},
    {"rel": "last", "href": "/api/v1/things?limit=10&offset=860"},
  ],
  "type": "/api/v1/things",
  "items": [
    ...
  ]
}</code></pre>

  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>collectionName</code> = Will be replaced with the name of the collection.</li>
    <li><code>total</code> = The total number of resources in the collection.</li>
    <li><code>limit</code> = The maximum number of resources per page of the collection.</li>
    <li><code>offset</code> = The current offset in the query.</li>
    <li><code>maxOffset</code> = The maximum offset that will return a page.</li>
    <li><code>totalPages</code> = The total number of pages in the collection.</li>
    <li><code>page</code> = The current page in the collection.</li>
    <li><code>links</code> = A pre-calculated array of links to navigate the collection. If you are on the last page then you will not receive the <code>"rel": ["next"]</code> link, and likewise if you are on the first page you will not receive the <code>"rel": ["prev"]</code></li>
    <li><code>type</code> = Describes the type of record in the <code>items</code> array.</li>
    <li><code>items</code> = Contains the resources being paginated.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="well well-small">Note: A 400 Bad Request will be returned if: <code>limit</code> is not divisible by 5, <code>offset</code> is not a multiple of the limit, or the use of <code>offset</code> would navigate to a page outside of the bounds of the collection.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-meta">Resource Metadata</h2>

  <p>Most of the API calls will return a JSON object called <code>meta</code>, as part of the <code>data</code> object, that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"meta":{

  <h3 id="basics-meta-permissions">Permissions</h3>

  <p>Permissions on the other hand are there to describe to you the data-changing actions you can perform to the resource in the current context. You should interpret permissions alone these lines:</p>

  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Permission</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>create</code></td>
        <td>Whether you can perform a <code>POST</code> request in this context, and therefore whether you have permission to add resources to a collection.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>read</code></td>
        <td>Whether you can perform a <code>GET</code> request in this context. This will always be <code>true</code>, as you will have received a 401 or 403 error if you did not have permission to read this resource.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>update</code></td>
        <td>Whether you can perform a <code>PUT</code> request in this context. The general guideline is that you can only update your own content, unless you are authenticated as a super user.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>delete</code></td>
        <td>Whether you can perform a <code>DELETE</code> request in this context. In general, you can only delete your own content, unless you are authenticated as a super user.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The permissions themselves are always at the site level, microcosm level, or the item level. That is, if you are the owner of an item by virtue of authoring it, then you have certain permissions that stem from that. Otherwise your permissions are derived from a Microcosm (if the API call relates to something that relates to a Microcosm, or from the site.</p>

  <p>Be sure to reflect this information within your client so that a user doesn't try to edit content when they will not have permission to do so.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-authentication">Authentication</h2>

  <p>We use <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/">Auth0</a> to authenticate users. This supplies us with a verified email address for each user but doesn't require any other personal information. When a user logs in with Auth0, you (the API client) are provided with an <code>Assertion</code> for the user which signifies that the user has successfully logged in to your application.</p>

  <p>When you sign up as an API client we will provide you with a client secret. This is used in conjunction with a Auth0 assertion to generate an <code>access token</code> for a user.</p>

  <p>To generate an access token, POST the following structure to <code>/auth</code>.

  <pre><code>{
  "Assertion": "suppliedByAuth0OnUserLogin",
  "ClientSecret": "suppliedByMicrocosmDuringDevClientRegistration"
}
</code></pre>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Optional?</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Assertion</code></td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>Required</td>
        <td>Assertion from Auth0 signifying a successful user login for the site.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>ClientSecret</code></td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>Required</td>
        <td>Client secret supplied when the API client was registered with Microco.sm.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>


  <p>Example request</p>
  <pre><code>curl -i \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"Assertion": "redacted", "ClientSecret": "redacted"}' \
https://dev1.microco.sm/api/v1/auth
</code></pre>

          <p>Example response</p>

          <pre><code>{
    "status": 200,
    "data": "theGeneratedAccessTokenToAuthenticateFutureRequestsByThisUser",
    "context": "",
    "error": null
}
</code></pre>

  <p>The <code>data</code> attribute above contains a string which is the generated access token. You can supply this with a request to the API to authenticate the user.</p>

  <p>Access tokens can be supplied as an HTTP header in the form <code>Authorization: Bearer {access_token}</code> or in the querystring in the form <code>access_token={redacted}</code>. If both header and querystring are provided, only the header will be examined. The header is the recommended way of providing the access token, the query string is made available to help support some clients which may not have access to the HTTP headers but the use of this is not encouraged.</p>

  <p>Tokens do not currently expire, nor do they have a particular scope. These are earmarked for future development as is allowing users to revoke older access tokens whilst logged in with a more recent access token.</p>

  <h2 id="basics-errors">Error Handling</h2>

  <p>As a developer implementing against the API, you must rely on the <a href="#http">HTTP status codes</a> returned to handle errors.</p>

  <p>If an error has occurred we will additionally inform you, the developer, of the cause of the error by populating the <code>error</code> property of the <a href="boiler">boiler plate</a>. The <code>error</code> property holds an array of strings to help you, the developer, to fix the issue.</p>
  
  <p class="well well-small">Note: The audience of the error string array is the developer implementing against the API. Please take care not to send error messages to the end user. Instead handle it in some elegant way in the UI that you present to the end user. To emphasise this: the error text is not localised, it will always be in English, it is designed to be understood by a developer and not an end user, it may change over time to be clearer to developers how to fix the error. Bottom line: Rely on HTTP status codes and nothing else.</p>
  
  <p>An example error (in this case for an invalid authentication access token):</p>
  
  <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "context":"",
   "status":403,
   "data":null,
   "error":[
      "You have supplied an invalid access token"
   ]
}
</code></pre>

  <p class="well well-small">Note: If you are making <a href="#jsonp">JSONP</a> requests and are making use of the <code>always200</code> flag, then you must look at the <code>status</code> property in the JSON response to ensure that you do not silently ignore errors.</p>
